# Simulation Models Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The scenario analysis page had simulation method options (Latin Hypercube, Sobol Sequence, Halton Sequence) displayed in the UI but they were not actually implemented. All simulations were running as mock/placeholder calculations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Advanced Simulation Engine (`src/services/advancedSimulationEngine.js`)
- **Latin Hypercube Sampling**: Improved coverage of input space with stratified sampling
- **Sobol Sequence**: Low-discrepancy quasi-random sequence for better convergence
- **Halton Sequence**: Alternative low-discrepancy sequence using prime numbers
- **Monte Carlo**: Standard random sampling (existing method)

### 2. Enhanced Features
#### **Statistical Quality Assessment**
- Convergence analysis with batch means
- Sample quality metrics by method
- Performance benchmarking (iterations/second, memory usage)

#### **Advanced Distribution Support**
- Normal distributions with Box-Muller transformation
- Triangular distributions for bounded estimates
- Uniform distributions for simple ranges
- Beta distributions for probability modeling
- Lognormal distributions for price modeling

#### **Correlation Handling**
- Cholesky decomposition for correlated variables
- Proper transformation from uniform to target distributions
- Maintains correlation structure across different sampling methods

#### **Real DCF Calculations**
- Actual discounted cash flow modeling
- Revenue growth projections
- EBITDA margin calculations
- Tax effects and capital expenditures
- Terminal value calculations
- Multiple financial metrics (NPV, IRR, payback period)

### 3. Updated UI Components
#### **Scenario Analysis Page** (`src/pages/scenario-analysis-sensitivity-tools/index.jsx`)
- Integrated real AdvancedSimulationEngine
- Proper distribution definitions for DCF variables
- Real-time progress updates
- Error handling and validation

#### **Statistical Summary Table** (`src/pages/scenario-analysis-sensitivity-tools/components/StatisticalSummaryTable.jsx`)
- Displays actual simulation results
- Shows simulation method used
- Enhanced statistics (skewness, kurtosis, confidence intervals)
- Convergence indicators
- Sample quality metrics

### 4. Key Improvements

#### **Method Efficiency Comparison**
- **Monte Carlo**: O(1/√n) convergence, standard efficiency
- **Latin Hypercube**: O(1/n) convergence, high efficiency, excellent coverage
- **Sobol Sequence**: O((log n)^d/n) convergence, very high efficiency
- **Halton Sequence**: O((log n)^d/n) convergence, good low-discrepancy

#### **Real Financial Modeling**
- Sophisticated DCF calculations with:
  - 5-year forecast projections
  - Terminal value calculations
  - Tax considerations
  - Working capital adjustments
  - Capital expenditure modeling

#### **Enhanced Analytics**
- Comprehensive statistical analysis
- Risk metrics and percentiles
- Confidence interval calculations
- Method-specific quality assessments
- Performance optimization

### 5. User Experience Improvements
- **Method Selection**: Users can now choose between 4 different sampling methods
- **Real Results**: Actual statistical analysis instead of mock data
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during calculations
- **Quality Indicators**: Shows simulation method efficiency and convergence
- **Detailed Statistics**: Enhanced statistical output with all key metrics

### 6. Technical Implementation
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between sampling methods and evaluation
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient algorithms for large simulations
- **Memory Management**: Controlled memory usage for large datasets
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new sampling methods or distributions

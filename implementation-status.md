## 📈 **IN-PROGRESS TASKS** 🔄

### **🧪 Current Execution Status**
```bash
🔄 Step 1: Applying Automated localStorage Migration ✅ COMPLETED
🔄 Step 2: Build Process Validation ⏳ NEXT
   npm run build              # Verify production build works
   npm run build:analyze     # Bundle optimization assessment

🔄 Step 3: Performance Benchmarking ⏳ PENDING
   npm run perf:check        # Lighthouse performance analysis
   npm run test:performance  # Service reliability testing

🔄 Step 4: Security Validation ⏳ PENDING
   npm run security:audit    # Vulnerability assessment
   npm run test:security     # Enterprise security verification
```

### **🔧 Immediate Next Actions (Developer Priority)**

#### **1. Build Validation** 🔥 MOST URGENT
```bash
# Critical: Validate that all fixes don't break the build process
npm run build               # Primary build test
npm run preview            # Preview mode validation
```

#### **2. Remaining localStorage Migration** 🔧 HIGH PRIORITY
```bash
# Apply automated migration to remaining source files
# Apply the automated fixes shown in migration script output
```

#### **3. Performance Baseline** 📊 MEDIUM PRIORITY
```bash
# Establish current performance metrics
npm run perf:check         # Lighthouse audit
npm run test:performance   # Service timeout test
```

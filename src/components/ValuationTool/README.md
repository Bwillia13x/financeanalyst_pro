### DCF Inputs

- **Current Revenue**: Starting revenue for projections
- **Revenue Growth Rate**: Annual growth percentage
- **EBITDA Margin**: Profitability assumption
- **Tax Rate**: Corporate tax rate
- **CapEx (% of Revenue)**: Capital expenditure requirement
- **Working Capital (% of Revenue)**: Working capital needs
- **Terminal Growth Rate**: Long-term growth assumption
- **Discount Rate**: Risk-adjusted return requirement
- **Projection Years**: Number of years to model

### LBO Inputs

- **Purchase Price**: Total acquisition cost
- **Equity Contribution**: Percentage of equity vs debt
- **Debt Amount**: Leverage amount
- **Interest Rate**: Cost of debt
- **Exit Multiple**: EBITDA multiple at exit
- **Exit Year**: Holding period
- **EBITDA Growth Rate**: Operational improvement
- **EBITDA Margin**: Profitability assumption
- **Transaction Fees**: Acquisition costs
- **Management Fees**: Annual management fees

## Methodology

### DCF Analysis

The DCF model calculates the present value of future free cash flows:

1. **Revenue Projections**: Start with current revenue and apply growth rate
2. **EBITDA Calculation**: Apply margin assumptions to projected revenue
3. **Free Cash Flow**: EBITDA - Taxes - CapEx - Working Capital Changes
4. **Present Value**: Discount each year's FCF using the discount rate
5. **Terminal Value**: Calculate value of cash flows beyond projection period
6. **Enterprise Value**: Sum of present value FCF + present value terminal value

### LBO Analysis

The LBO model evaluates returns from leveraged acquisition:

1. **Capital Structure**: Determine equity investment and debt financing
2. **Operational Improvements**: Model EBITDA growth under new ownership
3. **Exit Valuation**: Apply exit multiple to projected EBITDA
4. **Debt Paydown**: Account for interest and principal payments
5. **Fee Deductions**: Subtract transaction and management fees
6. **Return Calculation**: Calculate IRR and MOIC on equity investment

## Industry Benchmarks

### Typical Discount Rates

- Large Cap Public: 8-12%
- Mid Cap Private: 12-18%
- Small Cap Private: 15-25%
- Early Stage: 25-40%

### Exit Multiples by Sector

- Technology: 8-15x EBITDA
- Manufacturing: 6-10x EBITDA
- Healthcare: 8-12x EBITDA
- Consumer: 6-9x EBITDA

## Best Practices

### DCF Best Practices

- Use conservative growth assumptions based on industry benchmarks
- Consider multiple scenarios (base, upside, downside)
- Validate discount rate against comparable companies
- Ensure terminal growth rate is sustainable long-term
- Account for industry-specific factors

### LBO Best Practices

- Model realistic operational improvements
- Consider debt capacity and interest coverage
- Account for transaction and management fees
- Validate exit multiple against market comparables
- Stress test assumptions under different scenarios

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **React Components**: Modular, reusable components
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state
- **Calculations**: Pure JavaScript functions for financial modeling
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions

### Key Components

- `ValuationTool.jsx`: Main application component
- `ValuationToolDocs.jsx`: Documentation and methodology guide
- `DCFInputs`: DCF parameter input form
- `LBOInputs`: LBO parameter input form
- `ResultsDisplay`: Results visualization component

### Financial Formulas

#### DCF Calculations

```
Free Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation - CapEx - Working Capital Changes
Present Value = FCF / (1 + Discount Rate)^year
Terminal Value = Final FCF * (1 + Terminal Growth) / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth)
Enterprise Value = Î£ Present Value FCF + Present Value Terminal Value
```

#### LBO Calculations

```
Equity Investment = Purchase Price * Equity Contribution
Exit Value = Exit EBITDA * Exit Multiple
Net Exit Value = Exit Value - Remaining Debt - Fees
IRR = (Net Exit Value / Equity Investment)^(1/Exit Year) - 1
MOIC = Net Exit Value / Equity Investment
```

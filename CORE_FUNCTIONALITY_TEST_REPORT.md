## üîß CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **MISSING PLUGIN METHODS**
**Impact:** High - Advanced features completely non-functional

**Missing Methods:**
- `calculators.lbo()` - LBO analysis calculations
- `market-data.chart()` - Stock chart generation
- `portfolio.portfolio()` - Portfolio management operations
- `reporting.export()` - Data export functionality

### 2. **INCORRECT PERMISSION MAPPINGS**
**Impact:** High - Users cannot access intended features

**Issues Found:**
- `news` command requires `general:execute` (should be `market:read`)
- `report` commands require `general:execute` (should be reporting permissions)
- `pipeline` requires `utility:write` (should be automation permissions)
- `portfolio` requires `plugin:write` (should be portfolio permissions)

### 3. **INPUT SANITIZATION BYPASS**
**Impact:** Critical - Security vulnerability

**Issue:** Malicious inputs (XSS, SQL injection) are detected but still executed
**Required:** Complete blocking of malicious input patterns

### 4. **MONITORING THRESHOLDS**
**Impact:** Moderate - False positive alerts

**Issue:** Error rate threshold too sensitive (0.07% triggers critical alerts)
**Solution:** Adjust thresholds for realistic operational levels

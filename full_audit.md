Area	Template/URL	Finding	Severity	Evidence	Root cause	Recommended Fix (code/config)	Expected Impact	Notes
Rendering/SEO	/ (global SPA)	Primary content and metadata delivered client‚Äëside (CSR). Server HTML is minimal; risk of incomplete indexing.	High	view‚Äësource: <title>financeanalyst-pro</title>; module scripts; generic CRA meta.	Single‚Äëpage app built with React; no SSR/SSG or HTML pre-render for routes.	Adopt SSR/SSG (e.g., Next.js/Remix) or static pre‚Äërender for key routes; ensure route-level <title>, <meta>, JSON‚ÄëLD render server‚Äëside.	Improves crawlability, faster first paint, richer link previews; material SEO lift on branded/non‚Äëbranded queries.	Keep CSR for interactive modules; hydrate below‚Äëthe‚Äëfold.
SEO/Metadata	All routes	Non‚Äëunique <title> and missing per‚Äëroute <meta name='description'>.	High	Head shows single title 'financeanalyst-pro' for all routes.	Static head; metadata not set per view.	Use react‚Äëhelmet (SPA) or <Head> (Next.js) to set unique title/description per route based on copy and keywords.	Higher CTR from SERP; clearer IA for crawlers.	Target ~50‚Äì60 chars for title; 140‚Äì160 for description.
SEO/Canonical & Social	All routes	Canonical URL, Open Graph, and Twitter Card tags not observed.	Medium	No <link rel='canonical'>, og:title/description/image, twitter:card in head.	Omitted social/canonical metadata.	Add canonical tag per route; add OG/Twitter meta; generate preview image (1200√ó630).	Prevents duplicate indexing; corrects preview cards; improves share CTR.	Use absolute URLs in canonical and OG image.
Sitemap/Robots	/robots.txt, /sitemap.xml	robots.txt allows all (OK) but sitemap.xml not discoverable.	Low	robots.txt: 'User-agent: *\nDisallow:'; sitemap fetch returned no content in test environment.	Sitemap not generated or not deployed.	Generate and publish /sitemap.xml; reference in robots.txt via 'Sitemap: https://valor-ivx.com/sitemap.xml'.	Faster discovery of pages; better coverage.	Include updatedAt changefreq/priority only if meaningful.
Performance/JS Bundling	All routes	Large vendor bundles and multiple modulepreload chunks observed.	Medium	Head includes /assets/react-vendor-*.js, ui-vendor-*.js, utils-vendor-*.js, charts-vendor-*.js.	Monolithic vendor imports; heavy charting libs always loaded.	Code‚Äësplit by route; lazy‚Äëload charts and rarely used panels; tree‚Äëshake; remove dead deps; prefer dynamic import() per module.	Lower JS shipped, faster TTI/INP; improved mobile performance.	Bundle‚Äëanalyze and set performance budgets (JS < 200‚Äì300kb gz).
Images/Fonts	Global	No explicit preloads; modern formats not verified.	Low	No <link rel='preload'> entries observed for fonts/hero assets.	Default asset loading behavior.	Preload critical fonts with 'as=font' and 'crossorigin'; use font-display: swap; serve images as AVIF/WebP with width descriptors; add sizes.	Improved LCP and perceived speed.	Beware over-preload; audit with Lighthouse budgets.
Accessibility (WCAG¬†2.2)	Global	No skip‚Äëto‚Äëcontent link or landmark structure observed in the rendered UI (manual spot‚Äëcheck).	Medium	Header/navigation lacks visible skip link; ARIA landmarks not evident.	No a11y scaffolding in layout shell.	Add <a class='skip-link' href='#main'>Skip to content</a>; use semantic <main>, <nav>, <header>, <footer>; ensure focus styles and keyboard traps eliminated.	Better keyboard/screen‚Äëreader UX; WCAG conformance path.	Follow WCAG¬†2.2 AA; run axe/lighthouse-a11y on PRs.
Security Headers	Edge/Origin	Core security headers not observed on 403 test response (may also be missing on 200s).	High	403 response contained Content-Type only; HSTS/CSP/X-Frame-Options/X-Content-Type-Options/Referrer-Policy absent.	Default CDN/origin config.	Add HSTS (max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload), CSP with nonces/hashes (script-src 'self' 'nonce-...'), X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, Frame-Options or frame-ancestors, Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin, Permissions-Policy per features.	Reduces XSS/clickjacking/MIME sniff risks; stronger browser posture.	Roll out CSP in report‚Äëonly first; monitor violations.
Caching/Compression	Static assets	Cache policy and compression not verified; opportunities likely.	Medium	No Cache-Control/ETag/Content-Encoding observed in captured headers (on 403 path).	No explicit policies at CDN/origin for static assets.	Serve static assets with Cache-Control: public,max-age=31536000,immutable and hashed filenames; enable brotli/gzip on text assets; ETag/Last-Modified for HTML.	Reduced network cost; improved repeat views.	Validate HTML set to no-cache/no-store as appropriate.
PWA/Resilience	Global	Web App Manifest present; no service worker/offline handling observed.	Low	manifest.json defines name/theme; no SW registration seen.	PWA not implemented beyond manifest.	Add service worker for offline cache of shell and key routes; graceful error pages (custom 404/500).	Better resiliency; improved perceived reliability.	Ensure SW excludes dynamic financial data from cache.

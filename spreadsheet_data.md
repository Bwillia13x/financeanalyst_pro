    Revenue									Adjustment Rationale	
    Energy Devices			$ 000s	317.82 	270.15 	245.84 			1 - Normalize Marketing - I set marketing to a sustainable % of revenue (e.g., I32 = L2 × I12). A ~$37k spend on ~$3.7M revenue isn’t credible for acquisition/retention; normalizing avoids overstating profitability and reflects run-rate demand gen.	
    Injectables			$ 000s	1,123.65 	1,044.99 	930.04 			2 - Fix Operating Income Structure - I compute Operating Income = Gross Profit − Total S&B − Total OpEx (I53 = I23 − I29 − I50). The original layout under-subtracted S&B; this correction puts labor costs in the right place before OpEx.	
    Wellness			$ 000s	567.67 	652.82 	763.79 			3 - Owner Compensation Add-Back - I add back $300 (I54 = $L$3) to replace the seller’s draw with market-rate management. Buyers should underwrite the post-close org chart, not discretionary owner cash pulls.	
    Weightloss			$ 000s	617.21 	635.73 	718.37 			4 - EBITDA neutrality to Financing & Non-Cash - Interest is booked inside OpEx here, so I add back Interest and Depreciation to reach EBITDA (I56 = I55 + H37 + H42). EBITDA should be pre-financing and pre-non-cash.	
    Retail Sales			$ 000s	322.79 	331.66 	334.98 			5 - Remove One-Offs - I set Gain on asset sale to $0 in the adjusted column (non-recurring). That keeps Other income and Pre-tax focused on ongoing operations; EBITDA is unaffected by this.	
    Surgery			$ 000s	617.23 	685.12 	733.08 			6 - Make OpEx "adjusted" truly adjustable - I50 = SUM(I32:I49) so any future I-column normalizations (e.g., repairs, fees) flow through automatically—no mixed columns, no silent breaks.	
    Total Revenue			$ 000s	3,566.37 	3,620.47 	3,726.10 	3,726.10 		7 - Link valuation to the adjusted earnings base - Adjusted 2024 EBITDA (I56) is the single source of truth for valuation. If I change L2 (marketing %), L3 (owner add-back), or any I-column line, valuation updates immediately.
